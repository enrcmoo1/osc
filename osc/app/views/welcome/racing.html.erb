        <h3>Pendle Winter Race League 2012-2013</h3>

        Yes it's that time of year again. We are again inviting entries to our Winter Race League held on the 1st Saturday of October, November, December, February and March. All club members are welcome to join!<br> 
        <br>
        The dates of these events are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        Saturday October 5th 2012<br>
        Saturday November 2nd 2012<br>
        Saturday December 7th 2012<br>
        Saturday February 4th 2013<br>
        Saturday March 2rd 2013<br>
        <br>
        After downloading the entry form you should email entries to <a href ="mailto:pendleskiraces@live.co.uk">pendleskiraces@live.co.uk</a> and then read the league introduction and rules.<br>
        <br>
        Race details in summary:<br>
        <br>
        Cost - £8 per racer per race. £3 for ski and/or boot hire.<br>
        <br> 
        NOTE the skis we hire are recreational skis not race skis.<br>
        <br> 
        Teams are done in 3's or 4's and skiers need to be able to competently ski from the top of our slope and get round gates.This race is designed as an introduction to racing.<br> 
        <br>
        Age categories:<br>
        <br>
        Under 10 (born after October 1st 2002)<br>
        Under 13 (born after October 1st 1999)<br>
        Under 19 (born after October 1st 1993)<br>
        Over 19's<br>
        <br>
        You may ski up an age category but not down e.g. a 12 year old could ski in the U19s. Teams can be all girls, all boys or mixed. Each team needs a team captain who will whear the bib for their team and be responsible for getting their team to the start ready for their race. The teams do not need to have the same racers in each month but the team name will stay the same.<br>
        <br>
        A club can have as many teams as they want and we appreciate some teams may not race every month.<br>
        <br>
        The race office opens at 8am so ensure that you collect team bibs and rented kit after you have paid. Open practice lasts from 8.15 to 9.10am. Racing begins at 9.20am and finishes before 12 noon (we have to clear the slope for 12pm as there are lessons on)<br>
        <br>
        Each team will have 6 races against other teams in their age category. 4 points are gained for a win and 2 points for completing the course successfully. So if a team of 4 races a team of 3, the 4th racer must complete the course.<br>
        <br>
        Medals awarded to the first 3 teams in each age category on each race day. Overall the best 4 results count towards the perpetual shields awarded in March.<br>
        <br>
        Entries MUST be in by midnight the Thursday before the race. If a team subsequently pulls out then the planned race will go ahead, the remaining team must complete the course to win.<br>
        <br>
        The BBQ will be running as usual as well as the snack bar for drinks and sweets.</p>
